<h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
<p>Our results show that linear probes trained on Qwen3-0.6B activations are capable of distinguishing partially consistent directions across multiple intermediate layers, with the strongest performance concentrated in the middle of the network (e.g., Layers 14â€“16). These findings provide evidence that the property of pivotalness is encoded in linearly separable directions within the model's representation space. Notably, probes trained on skewed datasets achieved modest but consistent improvements in validation accuracy, suggesting that data curation plays a meaningful role in reducing Type I errors.</p>

<h2>Comparison with Previous Research</h2>
<p>Our work builds on the foundational PTS method introduced by Abdin et al., which identified pivotal tokens through computationally expensive binary search procedures. While PTS has been shown to be effective for steering models toward better reasoning success when incorporated into DPO fine-tuning, our probing approach offers a more efficient alternative that could enable real-time reasoning analysis where computational efficiency is critical.</p>

<p>The connection to broader mechanistic interpretability work on feature editing, causal tracing, and activation-level interventions extends these ideas from semantic features to reasoning dynamics, providing a new window into how models encode multi-step reasoning processes.</p>

<h2>Theoretical Implications</h2>
<p>The identification of linearly separable directions corresponding to pivotal tokens suggests that reasoning-critical features are encoded in interpretable ways within the model's representation space. This finding has several theoretical implications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Representation Structure:</strong> The existence of consistent, weighted directions across multiple layers suggests that pivotalness is not randomly distributed but follows a structured pattern in the latent space.</li>
  <li><strong>Reasoning Mechanisms:</strong> The concentration of discriminative signals in mid-to-late layers (14-16) suggests that reasoning-critical features emerge and become more linearly separable as information flows through the network.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Interpretability:</strong> The success of linear probes indicates that pivotal features are not highly nonlinear or interaction-dependent, making them more amenable to interpretation and intervention.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Implications</h2>
<p>While the probes themselves are diagnostic tools, they also open up hypotheses for future work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Representation Steering:</strong> The directions identified by the probes could potentially be used for steering: intervening on hidden activations to amplify or suppress pivotal features. Such interventions may alter reasoning trajectories, for example by introducing "skepticism" about low-confidence reasoning paths or reinforcing high-confidence steps.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Efficient PTS Alternatives:</strong> Because PTS requires multiple forward passes and oracle queries, probe-based classification represents a lightweight alternative for identifying pivotal tokens at runtime. This could enable applications where efficiency is critical, such as real-time reasoning analysis.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Model Debugging:</strong> The ability to identify pivotal tokens through linear probes could be used for model debugging and understanding failure modes in reasoning tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interpretable Approach:</strong> Linear probes provide a simple, interpretable method for identifying pivotal features without the computational overhead of PTS.</li>
  <li><strong>Layer-wise Analysis:</strong> Training probes independently per layer allows us to understand how pivotal features are represented across different network depths.</li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive Evaluation:</strong> Our evaluation includes multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC) and explores different aggregation strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducible Methodology:</strong> The approach is straightforward to implement and can be applied to other models and datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dataset Size:</strong> The relatively small dataset (83 training and 21 validation examples) restricts statistical power and may lead to overfitting despite the simplicity of linear probes.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent Layer Training:</strong> Training probes independently per layer may overlook distributed representations of pivotalness that only emerge across multiple layers.</li>
  <li><strong>Binary Classification:</strong> Restricting to binary classification excludes neutral tokens, which may miss subtler gradations in how tokens contribute to reasoning.</li>
  <li><strong>Linear Separability Assumption:</strong> Linear probes only test for linearly separable features, potentially missing nonlinear or interaction effects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Research Directions</h2>
<p>Our findings motivate several directions for future research:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross-layer Aggregation:</strong> Developing methods to aggregate probe predictions across multiple layers to capture distributed representations of pivotalness.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Steering Interventions:</strong> Exploring how the identified directions can be used for representation steering to improve reasoning performance.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Nonlinear Probes:</strong> Investigating whether more complex probe architectures can capture nonlinear or interaction effects in pivotal feature encoding.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Scalability Studies:</strong> Testing the approach on larger models and datasets to understand how pivotal feature encoding scales with model size.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Real-world Applications:</strong> Applying the method to practical reasoning tasks and evaluating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of probing for reasoning-specific features, and motivate future experiments in steering and scalable approximations to PTS. By reframing PTS through probing, we aim to lay the groundwork for mechanistic interventions into model reasoning, opening new possibilities for understanding and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models.</p>

<p>The identification of linearly separable directions corresponding to pivotal tokens represents a significant step toward understanding how models encode reasoning processes, with implications for both interpretability research and practical applications in AI systems.</p>
